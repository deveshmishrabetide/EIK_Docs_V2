# Edgegap Integration

Edgegap is a cloud-based game server hosting platform that provides low-latency, globally distributed game servers. The EIK Edgegap plugin allows you to seamlessly integrate Edgegap's hosting services with your EOS-powered game.

## Key Features

### Infrastructure & Performance
- **Global Deployment**: 100+ edge locations across major cloud providers (AWS, Google Cloud, Azure)
- **Ultra-Low Latency**: Sub-50ms connections for competitive gameplay
- **Auto-Scaling**: Dynamic server scaling based on player demand with intelligent load balancing
- **Container-Based**: Lightweight deployment with efficient resource usage

## EdgeGap Integration Kit 

We have made a plugin, which is sponsored by the Edgegap Team, which makes integrating with Edgegap a few minutes work :D

The plugin is available for free at :

## Integration with EGIK

Integrating EGIK with EIK is pretty straightforward

1. Setup EOS Dedicated Servers as per [this doc](http://localhost:3001/multiplayer/dedicatedservers/configuration)
2. Setup Edgegap Integration kit using, either this [video](https://youtu.be/xNQu-lAssRY) or [this doc](https://egik.betide.studio/servers/deployment)
3. Finally, deploy the servers on the Edgegap platform, and you should be able to connect.

## Important Notes

1. There are three ways to use EGIK + EOS:

- first is either you make a dedicated server, deploy a server using the Edgegap's website and connect to the IP or use the Find EIK Sessions (if you made a session on the dedicated server, so this means you need the server to be running to create a EOS Session). This is the easist and striaghtforward usage.
- Second is you use the Edgegap's API to deploy a server (available in EGIK too), this is a better option if you want to find, join and create dedicated servers directly. We have covered this approach [in this video](https://youtu.be/PJeciwR4e7g?si=hv4slShFu6RSBI_M)
- Third is you use the Edgegap's Matchmaker, which scales the server as and when required and you can have one of the best matchmaking solutions. We have covered this approach [in this video](https://youtu.be/2ow6rPnEsxM?si=Lms_UEQrA8jWj7ZT)

2. You can also use [Team Matchmaking](https://youtu.be/0-hTqhm9XhY?si=P7dkWFVyuBPCY1NR) and [Backfills](https://youtu.be/6-S71n-JJ5A?si=EpOBjiaOYysgfpTJ), as in that place, EOS will be used as the NetDriver only.
